Instrumental Outro
Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Runnin' out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die, would you even cry?
If I end my life, would you hold me tight then?

Runnin' up that hill, you pushin' me back
Wish that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)

: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL
Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? Because I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like Zoloft
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passin' on and out
(And out, and out)

Break: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL & Lil Peep
It wasn't somethin' that I thought about

But, knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That’s how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn’t somethin' ‘til you brought it up
I knew that you were tryna make it out
Without a single scar, clawin' at my heart
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it’s not that easy
Lay me down, just please don’t leave me
I remember you were climbin' on top of me
Why you actin' like you fuckin' forgot me?
I’ve been dreamin' about a place out in Hollywood
Tell my mama that I’m movin' to Hollywood


Bring me down, it’s not that easy
Lay me down, just please don’t leave me

"I mean it been going on and building up for so many years that I was.. ya'know... suicidal, I mean I just didn't wanna live; so I just thought: 'If I'm gonna die, if I'm gonna kill myself, I should take some drugs', ya'know.. huh"

Outro: MTV interview with Kurt Cobain, 1993
"May as well become a junkie because I felt like a junkie everyday, ya'know? waking up starving, just forcing myself to eat, ya'know, barfing it back up.. I mean he almost died..."
I had a plan to kill
Myself and you for real
With my gun, I'll take your life
I'm no fun without my knife


If I I want to I will cut you, I will make you feel my pain
If I need to I will bleed you, I will make you go insane
When the time comes I will sacrifice my love in the moonlight

You act kind, I don't act kind at all, at all: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL & DØVES
You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
And I'm so lost, under club lights
In the all black, GothBoiClique


GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs


Fucked up in the back of the club
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
I got scars on me, no love
Light a candle and I pray for Døves
And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood
It's so fucked
So tell me what is love
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
Did I really want it?
And why can't I remember?
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
It's a slow drug
And I swear that
But it's true love
These are true lines


Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed (tryin' so hard)
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?!"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse


GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugsIntro
Man, I don't know what the fuck goin' on lately, bro
Everybody actin' all different and shit

Used to do childish stuff
This is just the beginning
You gotta be ? for the whole team
Thought you special, you a lame
Now I wanna cry, but I'm with cry baby
Fuck with my emotions
You can get the fuck
I flexed up
With the best love
You was only good for a quick fuck
Bust a couple nuts now I gotta run
Cooling off, you like the barrel at the end of my gun
Point it to my temple, I'm done
Oh, this tempo and your girl got me sprung
My house is cramped
Want a dead president
Fuck the sentiment
I'ma put the bullet to the back of my head


Everything here is dead
It's easier to see when its night
I just heard a voice in my head
It asked me if I'm gon' be alright
Leave me in the back of your head
Yeah you know im talking to you
Not too long ago
I probably would have died for youIntro: Lil Peep
Why you always tryna spend my money?
Why you always gotta act so funny?

While your bitch give me brains in the back of the Hummer
California girls fuckin' with me in the summer
It's that California world shit, California color

I love gettin' high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm makin' music to cry to

Smoke blunts in my ride, turn the music up, I like the vibes
I’m fine, you should worry about yourself every once in awhile
Cracking a smile while I cut myself
Sometimes it feels like nothing help
And that prescription take the pain away
I’m taking acid if it rain today
Watch the clouds while I waste away
Dripping out the sink
No one ever knows what I’m sipping out my drink
I don´t give a fuck how you feeling about me
Back of the club, bad bitches around me
Back in the day why everyone doubt me
Look at my outfit, somebody count me
Choke on my dick if you're trying to shade me
I don´t give a fuck if you're trying to play me
I don´t give a fuck if you're trying to save me
Yeah I got bitches not one of them date me

Verse: Eddy Baker
Know I pulled up with a box of blunts
Range Rover filled with sluts
Shoe box filled with blunts
Rolling up that stinky skunk
Light it up, they know what´s up
Getting money with my bros
Bad bitches they show us love
Hit the crib and let us fuck
Came in sober leaving  drunk
Young nigga, I'm having fun
Lean in my Hawaiian punch
Drank too much I'm throwing up
All my shows be going up
That´s why your girl be choosing us

My life like Ferris Bueller was
Posted in the breakfast club
Just like ? smoking drugs
Where's my molly we´re gon try and see if she fuck with a thug
Healthyboyz cartel
Got narcotics if you need a buzz
Blowing all my money on designer cuz I'm young and dumbSnippet
We can have sex, chill out, smoke a sack
Try to understand that yo new man wack, he a sad
Make you drip drip down from a bad
She can take dick like she fat
You've been riding 'round on flats
I can tell by the way you write yo raps
Snakes don't come around facts
They trapped to the lies and the racks
If you keep it real, I keep it real back
I keep it real back so she on my back
Drinking that yack, smoking a sack, ooh
I put yo town in the map, gimme some that
Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ridin' 'round downtown with me
Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ridin' 'round downtown with Peep


I be in the backseat smoking on thrax
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B, free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back

I'll be right here, when you step out the car
I see you from afar, but I know who you are
I know exactly who you are, what you're lookin' for
I know exactly where it starts, and I'm not lookin' forward to the end
Because we're not gonna last
Because we took it too fast, and that's a good way to crash and burn
What I learned, I don't like takin' my turn
If she mine, she gon' be mine until we ash in an urn
Let me burn, let me swerve, let me pull up on the curb
Now I'm lookin' so absurd, but I’m all that they heard, at the party pull-up Rari
Up in the haze on the scene up in the haze on the scene
Light a hundred fuckin' dutchs and then I follow my dreams
Girl, you're fuckin' with Lil Peep, I’m the king of the teens
I just dropped a couple singles and take over the scene
Got the internet buzzin', 20 thousand a week
Now I practice gettin' pussy, I practice all that I preach
Peep

: Gizmo
I'll be right there when you need me close
I'll always be around when you need me the most
But I know, that you've been tryna get away from me
But you just don't know what to say to me
I just gotta do what I think I'm meant to
Everything I said is true in that text I sent you
So if you ain't gon' be my boo, then just do you
I'm smokin' blunts, like they cigarettes
I still ain't shit, I ain't gotten any bigger yet
But that factor ain't somethin' that really matters to me
Ain't nothin' to think about when I'm chillin', smokin' my weed
I burn it down, and then proceed to seek out all my hopes and dreams
The future holds itself so it ain't really what it seems
If I can't get to where I want, I'll be pissed
I'll tie my neck up in a noose, kick the chair and slit my wristsIntro: Lil Peep
Yo, throw me the keys, bruh

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is
You're the reason mine is beatin'


I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty, I wish to explore your features secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option, watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you, take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel, in your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got no where to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got 'till I'm gone
And that's a promise, unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest


I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is
You're the reason mine is beatin'
Everyone hates me, but nobody knows me
Where did the time go, could somebody show me?
Getting a ride slow, you know where I'm going
Back at the club girl, your feelings are showing
How can I not stare, the way that you're glowing?
I am a nightmare you don't wanna know me
Running my fingers through your hair
Makes me remember everything, why don't you hate me?


I'll be the first there
And I'll be the last there
I'm not gonna last here
I'm not gonna last long
I will be right here
I'll buy you a flight here
I'll give you a night here
We gotta move on


Everyone hates me, but nobody knows me
Where did the time go, could somebody show me?
Getting a ride slow, you know where I'm going
Back at the club girl, your feelings are showing
How can I not stare, the way that you're glowing?
I am a nightmare you don't wanna know me
Running my fingers through your hair
Makes me remember everything, why don't you hate me?
Why don't you hate me?


I'll be the first there
And I'll be the last there
I'm not gonna last here
I'm not gonna last long
I'll be the first there
And I'll be the last there
I'm not gonna last here
I'm not gonna last long
Catch me in the stairway, aye, aye
Catch me in the, yeah, catch me in the, aye
Catch me in the stairway, aye, aye

Verse: Lil Peep
Wipe off all that fishscale
When they get me, won't you pay my bills
Bitch, I get it in the fuckin' mail
Like my bitches thick, but I'm so frail
If I counted all the blunts I smoked
If I counted all the hearts I broke
If you've doubted I'ma make you choke
On your word for free
I ain't come with a fee, not me, not me
Catch me in the stairway
I'm on that I don't fuckin' care way
It's like three up in my time zone
It's like three up in my styrofoamIntro
No-one wants to kiss a girl in black


Worry 'bout yourself, baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feelin' like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was lookin' for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers


Don't stutter, slang from the gutter
Got bang for ya' butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shinin' thru' the shutter
Say she over me
Whatever, 'cause she underneath my cover
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your hoe
Bet you wish you got me mad
You don't, you won't, not never
Stop blowin' up my phone

Interlude
Yo, run that shit back for me


Worry 'bout yourself, baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feelin' like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was lookin' for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers
I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got no where left to go
You got no one else to turn to now
Will you cry when you die and there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burnin' down
Or will you take your stand tonight
Get your ass away from that light
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby, drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave
(Baby, I'll leave too)

From the top
I'm not gonna worry about last night again
You just wanna see me fall again
That's alright, I know you'll be back again for the last time
You know my pain and you know my life
You are the dark and you are the light
I steal the look when you're not with me
I wrote the book on feeling empty
Why did I ever take a chance on you?
I made you feel empty like the drugs that you do
You told me that you love me that's not easy to do
But girl, don't tell me that you love me
If you're just gonna leave
Don't tell me that you love me
It means nothing to me
No, no


Beat FiendsIntro: Sample from "It's a Wonderful Life"
"What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?
You, you want the moon?
Just say the word and I’ll throw a lasso around it and pull it down
Hey. That’s a pretty good idea
I’ll give you the moon, Mary"
"I'll take it"


Baby, I could give you the moon
You know he can't do what I do
Yeah, It's true
Girl, I think I'm dyin' real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
Baby, I could give you the moon
You know he can't do what I do
Yeah, It's true
Girl, I think I'm dyin' real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
I'ma keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wastin' my time
Givin' you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin', I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin' truck out (skrr)
Tryna buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the moon and bug the fuck out

Outro: Sample from "It's a Wonderful Life"
"Mary, I know what I’m going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that
I’m shaking the dust of this crummy little town far behind and I’m going to see the world
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum. Then I’m coming back here and I’ll go to college and see what they know and then I’m going to build things
I’m going to build air fields. I’m going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
I’m going to build s a mile long. Well, are you going to throw a rock?
Hey, that’s pretty good. What’d you wish, Mary?"Intro
Give me your all, all
Give me your all, all, all, all


Give me your all, baby I ain't comin' up to fall
At first, you gotta crawl, then you get this tall
I ain't had much help now I'm all on my own
In my room, why the fuck is people callin' my phone?
Wish it's you but it ain't, now I'm stuck in my head
Feelin' like I'm dead lookin' up from my bed
I don't need nothin', 'cept a dollar and a dream
I don't even need the dollar, I would rather have a bean


I had no one, you were someone
Someone to help me, someone to save me
I had no one, you were someone
Someone to help me, someone to save me from myself

Give me your all, all
You don't know me at all
I ain't pickin' up when I get your call
I just flipped a quarter bag and blew it at the mall
I ain't worried 'bout what the fuck you gotta say at all
Keep it to yourself, drugs on the shelf
If it wasn't for my plug then I wouldn't have this belt
Yeah I need some help, yeah I'm goin' to hell
All my exes dead in the basement you can smell


I just need a goth queen tonight
I just wanna fuck you in the candle light

Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die, I'ma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time, but I never wanna do that again
Nothin' worse than losin' a friend
And the feelin' you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waitin' for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby, I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna hurt you girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit a love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it allVerse: Lil Peep
Now I'm in the clouds with an angel
Baby I got tatted on my halo
I just want a hunnid million pesos
I just wanna lay low, sleeping on a bankroll
Said she wanna fuck me, if you say so
But I ain't forgetting what I came fo'

Walking through the flames with my chain on
Gold slugs on my teeth with a cape on

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke?
Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something that I couldn't recall
Makin' you cry the way you did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it


You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You wouldn't wait (skrrt)

You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me


I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly, to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you


Do you remember when you didn't care 'bout me?
Now I'm your everything and I've got you on your knees
I got this little problem, I wanna make you bleed
"So what's the problem?" she said
"Baby, make me scream!"

I'd still blow my brains out just for you

Fuck...Verse: Lil Peep
When I'm comin' down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again?
(Did I let you down again)
If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breakin' down again
(Breakin' down again)
But If I need to go
Just to show you I don't fuckin' care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch
That's cool with me
So act like you don't know
That I don't fuckin' stare at anybody else
The way I do when it's only me and you


You know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me
You know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me
It's me

Outro: Lacey Sturm
My arms are searchin' for you
My arms are out stretched towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for youIntro
Spoken words were meant to last, but the picture faded fast
The words "I love you" meant so much, now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore and think about our first kiss by the tree And how it meant so much to me


Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some getting used to
And I think I'm getting through to you
But, all that shit I put you through ain't right
And I know that I'm barely ever home
But, I think of you on the road
You know I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak
That's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you
Said "I hate you", 'cause I knew that you would never love me too

Step in the club, they tryna get cameras in focus
I'm a vampire, I do not like the light on me
Fuck a friend, fuck a homie, I'm all by my lonely
Kush smoking, wine pouring at four in the morning

Break the cocaine off the brick and put it in her asshole
Vampire in the moonlight, counting up the pesos

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room
I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles

Baby, I was blazin' in my plain white tee

"You're looking a little morose sunny, what's hitting you?"
"Just like losing my faith with humanity.."
"Can you narrow it down for me?"
"I just, wonder, if like.. two people can stay together for good?"
"You mean like couples?"
"Yaknow.. like, people in love.."
"Are you having boys trouble? 'cause I gotta be honest, I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition.. that's kinda messed up.."
"No dad, it's not"
"I mean that's pretty skanky.. isn't that what you girls call it skanky? skeevy?
"Please stop"
"Tore up from the floor up?"
"That's just not what it's about... I just need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever"
"Well, it's not easy, that's for sure."


We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same
If you couldn't tell
It's just another day
In this Little town (Leave this little town)
We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same
If you couldn't tell
It's just another day
In this Little town
Leave this little town

I'ma bout' to give her everything she ever wanted and more
What I deliver it's something that can't be bought at the store
I'm tryna bring you with me baby while I'm finding myself
That feeling when you kiss me tells me I don't need no one else
I had to lose my mind a couple times to find out its you
I had to run around the world girl just to be here it's true
These other woman don't got nothing on the way that she moves
Lets pick up right where we left off last night inside of my room


When the time come
I'll be right here
Sippin' liquor with a grin on my face, for you
I got nothing left to keep me awake
I don't got no better thing to do than sit here and wait
For you
For you

Run away with the one

Would you lie here 'til I die?

I can see right through
And you know it's true

So, I'm gettin' high all week without you

I wish I didn't play a part to break you
(I wish I didn't play a part to break you)
I wish I didn't do a lot of the shit I do

And I wish you didn't too


Tell me that you hate me
I just wanna hear that baby
You could blame me, but you
Love me and we could never lose
That


Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you (thinkin' about you)

Yeah I do it for my mama now

Blood drippin' from my Prada

I'm tryna get you out my fuckin' life (fuckin' life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right (wrong)

Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, aye


Ohhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Nooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhh, fuck is you talkin' 'bout? My shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole
For eternity, so they can reap what they sow
Ohhh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow
Nooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhh, I don't know why you in love with me, ho
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

I can't read your mind
Why do you even lie to me?
Still you can't realize
When you ? hands run down
Your spine I wish you where mine
?
Words can not describe this
I got drugs in my coat, I put love in my coke
Everywhere I go, hoes wanna give me throat
I got mud, I got blow, I get lonely on my own
Tell my plug hit my phone, and your bitch give me dome
Back to the drugs, pop a pill, fall in love
With a stripper in the club, I got demons in my mud
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Coke in her nose and my dick all in her butt
Red drop shawty, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck, hell nah

Verse: KirbLaGoop
Two blue pills and they both 30 millis
I be flippin' in the city if I got Bobby and Whitney
I got 2 for the 20 yeah they know I get it in
I be flippin' on the 10 with my kin, fuck a friend
7.5. rollin' live 'cause they know it's west side
In the north cross the track, where I ride where I die
That's why I got it tatted on me, you can see it on my back
Yeah, I'm 100 til the death and you can hear it in my breath
I'm never ever pealin', I've never ever froze
Stay true I was told put a hunna on the stove
I'ma never switch up, and I never ever change
My whole life I've been strugglin', I'll forever be the same


I got drugs in my coat, I put love in my coke
Everywhere I go, hoes wanna give me throat
I got mud, I got blow, I get lonely on my own
Tell my plug hit my phone, and your bitch give me dome
Back to the drugs, pop a pill, fall in love
With a stripper in the club, I got demons in my mud
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Coke in her nose and my dick all in her butt
Red drop shawty, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck, hell nah
I've been poppin' pills, I've been tryna forget about you
But, honestly, I've got regrets 'bout you
Baby, it's over now, you're gonna cry all night
I'm gonna smile at you when I see you and pretend that I'm alright
I'm never sober now, I'm gettin' high all night
I'm about to put this in my system to erase you from my mind

: Horse Head
I was in lust with you
Thought that I loved you, but I got the two confused
I don't wanna fall asleep with you in my head and I know that
You regret some things you said
But, honestly, I have regrets about you


I've been poppin' pills, I've been tryna forget about you

Baby, how you doing? I know you're not doing the best but I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin alone 'cause I'm here, I'm always right here
Tell me that I'm dumb, I love to get numb
I know that I'm young but I'm still right here
I don't give a fuck, I love who I love and girl you're that one so I'll wait right here (GothBoiClique)

Baby, I'm leaving, I'm not taking anything but you
Picture us escaping, in the background of the photo
I see you, I remember the time
I remember hearts sewn together with twine
Just remember that I am still right here
And if you doubt me that's just fine, and when it comes clear
I will be waiting right here, just tell me if you need me
And I will meet you right there

Grab my knife


Cut my ties and hold my breath

All the lights inside my room
Saw the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice, put the blame on you

Aye, I pull up in a coupe
Lookin' like soup

Pouring up the Act when I'm in Houston like I'm Maxo
I had the Act inside the drought
And I'm smoking cookies, smoking cookie girl scout
And I'm stepping on the gas stove
I just downed a Xanny and I hope that I don't crash though
Niggas hating on me and I know that it's the cash flow
Please don't call my phone if you ain't talking 'bout the cash, hoe

Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (yeah)
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter of fact, I ain't ever asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone the family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces


Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'

Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart from her

Fucking with nothing but ?
Schema the posse
A posse of demons
You'll see when you look in my eyes
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall
This is the girl I told that we could have it all


This is the life I made and I can't go back to fall
Back to fall, back to everyone I ever knew at all
Back to small town blues, and not a clue of what's goin' on
Back to old routines, and wedding rings and livin' at the mall, yeah


I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall

Baby, I'm a drug, you're addicted to my love
I thought you were the one, but you were just another one
Call me Hellboy, I got fire in my blunt
Don't call me emo, don't call me punk
I'm a vampire, bitch, I'm countin' money up
I'm with Lil Peep, yeah, we hotter than the sun
You should tell your boyfriend stop tryna be like us
Tatted on my face, baby, I don't give a fuck


I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I’ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs (Oh, no)
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain
I’m clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me


Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no

Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, try not take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked

Smokin' thraxx, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwin' shade like you finna face me

Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch, I got plenty, on my bottle it say "Remy", on my belt
That shit say Fendi and the back green (bling)


Got me talkin' bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talkin' bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up

It's somethin' in the bud, man, I need a new plug (plug)
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb 'cause they give me all their brains


Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch, I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Drivin' fast when she listenin' to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show, my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime, pussy make me happy


Got me talkin' bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talkin' bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's somethin' in the bud man, I need a new plug

But, I just find I been lyin'
Lyin' to myself
I don't need your help

Anybody tryn' see me shine

You could stand aside

Club lights, we fight every night
Baby, I don't wanna do that
Your type, jeans tight, dirty Sprite
She like "how the fuck you do that?"
I can't be there all the time
But you know I gotta prove that
I can't leave here anytime soon
I got somethin' to do, yeah


Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I'm goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams


I know you wanna FaceTime, baby, I have Samsung
When I met your mom, she told me I was handsome
You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
3AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window
You're a thousand miles away, I snort a thousand lines
Step inside the club, cameras flashin' in my eyes

Damn son, where'd you find this?


Screamin' oh my mind
That head so fine
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
Get my face recognized
We can do anything
Worth remembering
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screamin' oh my mind
That head so fine
Make a grown man cry, cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wanna be
Nobody wants to talk to me, but everyone wants to walk with me
And I always been that kid, maybe I won't be if I live
Long enough, but I think I'ma die now, yah, aye, aye
I just keep it to myself and I try not to cry too loud
I just wanna lay my head on your chest, so I'm as close as it gets to your heart
We can fall apart, start over again
Nobody knows me, nobody knows one thing about me
Everyone doubts me
But, I'ma make it all come true, and I do it for you
I know all about the pains that you go through

All they do is try
Woke up on a lonely day, she can’t help but wonder why, yeah
Punk star


Many men have tried to save her but all they do is try
Woke up on a lonely day, she can’t help but wonder why?
I saw it on her face, she wants to make those fuckers cry
She ends up in a better place inside when she get high
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
I’m not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
Stick that needle in my eye

Verse: Lil Peep
She won’t come with me, she ain’t gonna run with me
Now I’m breaking down again...
Blue skies start turning grey, when I tell her that I’m fine
Ash on the windowpane can I kiss you on your spine?
I watched her walk away, but don’t tell me she ain’t mine
She’s got this little blade and she cuts me when I lie
When I lie
Cuts me when I lie
When I lie, yeah

Feels like we're a world away
But we in the same room, be my girl, today at least
She don't even know my name
But she look me in the eyes like she know my pain, that's me
And she always let me be myself, she don't ever take bread
She don't need no help, that's real
While I'm busy tryna to get my wealth
She ain't worry about a thing except my dick and my health, that's real


She sees the things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me
She sees the things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same


Today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna come back to you
I know, I did a little blow and I never wrote back to you
My love, I wanna give it all to you
Baby, I just wanna ball with you
I could see the end was comin' near the way I do
About you now


Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the sameIntro
